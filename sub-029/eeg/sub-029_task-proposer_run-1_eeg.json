    "TaskDescription": "The task is playing the Ultimatum Game. The game involves two players and the goal is to split a certain sum of money between the players (here, 10CHF). The first player (proposer) offers part of the money to the second player (responder).  If responder agrees on the proposed split, both players receive their share of money. If responder refuses the offer, both players get nothing. In this task, the participant is playing as proposer making an offer of money. The player is then provided feedback with a happy or sad face, indicating whether the offer was accepted or not. The responses are computer generated, in a way to emulate human behaviour, with higher acceptance rates of higher offers. The players were not told they are playing against a computer. Each repetition takes 6s beginning with a fixation cross, then the participant makes an offer and receives the response. This is followed by the a 2s rest. ",
