    "TaskDescription": "The task is playing the Ultimatum Game. The game involves two players and the goal is to split a certain sum of money between the players (here, 10CHF). The first player (proposer) offers part of the money to the second player (responder).  If responder agrees on the proposed split, both players receive their share of money. If responder refuses the offer, both players get nothing. In this task, the participant is playing as responder, making decisions to refuse or accept the offer. The offers are made by the computer and are randomly drawn from a normal distribution centred around 3CHF. The players were not told they are playing against a computer. Each repetition takes 6s beginning with a fixation cross, then the offer is presented and the participant makes a decision. This is followed by the a 2s rest. ",
